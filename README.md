c-base makes space rock, of course.

Some ideas.

* a space journey through the solar system into the sun or the other way round. in any case, make a track per planet, or use plantes as inspiration.

* planets can correspond to different scales or harmonies. 

* Create a file here per song / track. 

* denote some stuff - like, 4/4 or 3/4 or 12/4 or slow heavy blues

* denote instrumentation / musicians.
